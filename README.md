# Average Whatever
Average Whatever will calcultate your average per day of an activity of your choice. 

I use it to keep track of my daily goal of 50 daily pushups, or rather - my goal of an average of 50 pushups a day. Obviously there are days I simply forget doing a single one, but since this is tracked I can pick them up by doing 50+ the next day. Average-Whatever will tell me how many I need to do to reach my goal of average 50 a day.

You:
* define the activity by specifying a suitable name
* provide a goal, that is the calculated average per day you aim for
* track the activity by incrementing occurances, preferably at a dayly basis

Average Whatever:
* will keep track of total occurances
* will do the hard math and present an average per day
* will display how your current status is related to your goal
